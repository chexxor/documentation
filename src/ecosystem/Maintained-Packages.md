# Maintained PureScript Packages

The following resources can be used to find actively maintained libraries written by the PureScript community:

- [Pursuit](https://pursuit.purescript.org) is PureScript's package database, which hosts library documentation. Packages on Pursuit have to be compatible with at least the latest major release of the compiler, which gives some indication of how well maintained they are.
- The [package set](https://github.com/purescript/package-sets) repository contains curated lists of packages which are known to build with various versions of the PureScript compiler. While this list isn't as complete as the one on Pursuit, it is more specific to the particular compiler version, with one package set being tagged for each compiler release.
