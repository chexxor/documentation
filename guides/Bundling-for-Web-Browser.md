# Bundling for a Web Browser

Currently, the PureScript compiler outputs CommonJS-formatted JavaScript modules, which is just one of several JavaScript module formats. Other JavaScript module formats include AMD, UMD, ES6, IIFE, SystemJS, and Global. The CommonJS module format was invented by the early NodeJS app ecosystem, as it has a different set of limitations than the web browser app ecosystem. The primary difference that relates to JavaScript module formats is that of loading dependent modules. NodeJS is a customized JavaScript runtime, and one of the features they added to the JavaScript language is support for synchronous module loading. NodeJS can do this while a web browser can not because NodeJS loads dependent modules using simple filesystem access, a relatively low performance cost, whereas a web browser needs to send an HTTP request to the website's server to request subsequent modules, a quite large performance cost.

## Bundling

To run a JavaScript app which uses CommonJS-formatted modules in a web browser, then, requires compiling it to a module format supported by a web browser. In simple browser apps, the resulting output will likely be just a single, very big JavaScript file with modules removed or wrapped in a similar implementation of CommonJS modules.

The programs which perform this compilation process are generally called "bundlers". The first program which did this was [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) but many alternative bundlers have been created since then. Currently the most popular and well-supported bundler is [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), but other fine options include [RollupJS](https://rollupjs.org/) and [ParcelJS](https://parceljs.org/). Generally, a bundler works by specifying an entrypoint JavaScript file, a desired output module format, and other functions to perform while the bundler traverses and bundles modules, called plugins.

See the documentation provided by those tools for full information of how to use them. As an introduction, we'll see a basic example of these tools.

Note that these tools will simply bundle a JavaScript file's dependencies into that file. A JavaScript file produced by a PureScript module will only define functions, not execute them. If you pass such a file into a bundler and simply load it into a browser, you might be disappointed to see that your project's `main` function isn't executed. To execute it in the browser requires a JavaScript file which imports the `main` function and executes it. The make your project executable, follow the bundler examples below while replacing `output/Main/index.js` with a JavaScript which executes your project. Following is an example JavaScript file which does this, here called `main-runner.js`.

``` JavaScript
// main-runner.js

// Using ES6 modules, if your bundler expects ES6 modules.
import { main } from "./output/Main/index.js"
main();

// Or using CommonJS module, if your bundler expects CommonJS modules.
// var Main = require("./output/Main/index.js");
// Main.main();
```


### Webpack

Install Webpack using their [installation guide](https://webpack.js.org/guides/installation/) or a different method of your choice. You might also need to install a "webpack-cli" package.

Webpack supports configuration by command-line arguments and by configuration file, but because many configuration options can't be defined by command-line arguments, it's recommended to use a configuration file. Create a webpack configuration file by entering the following into a "webpack.config.js" file in the root of your project directory.

``` JavaScript
// webpack.config.js

module.exports = {
  // Enter here. If the name of your PureScript entry module is named "Main",
  //   by default it will be output to the "./output/Main/index.js" file.
  entry: './output/Main/index.js',
  // Output the bundled program to "bundle.js" file in the current directory.
  output: {
    filename: 'bundle.js',
    path: __dirname
  }
};
```

Then execute Webpack.

``` sh
# If you installed from NPM
$ ./node_modules/.bin/webpack
```

Webpack should output something like the following. You can see it produced one asset, called bundle.js, which it called "Chunk number 0", and you can see each module which was included in that bundle.

``` sh

  [47] ./output/Main/index.js 313 bytes {0} [built]
    + 33 hidden modules
```


### RollupJS

Install RollupJS using their [quick start guide](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en#quick-start) or a different method of your choice.

Rollup supports configuration by command-line arguments and by configuration file, but because some configuration options can't be defined by command-line arguments, such as plugins, it's recommended to use a configuration file. Create a RollupJS configuration file by entering the following into a "rollup.config.js" file in the root of your project directory.

``` JavaScript
// rollup.config.js

// RollupJS supports only ES6 modules.
// PureScript outputs CommonJS modules and refers to other PS modules using Node-style
//   module refereneces, so we need to add support for this to Rollup using two plugins.
import commonjs from 'rollup-plugin-commonjs';
import nodeResolve from 'rollup-plugin-node-resolve';

export default {
  input: 'output/Main/index.js',
  output: {
    file: 'myapp-bundle.js',
    // If you want to make an in-browser executable, you'll need an input like "main-runner.js" and use an output format of "iife".
    format: 'cjs',
    exports: 'named'
  },
  plugins: [
    nodeResolve(),
    commonjs()
  ]
};
```

Then execute RollupJS.

``` sh
# If you installed from NPM
$ ./node_modules/.bin/rollup -c
```

RollupJS should output something like the following. You can see it bundled "output/Main/index.js" and its dependencies into the "myapp-bundle.js" file.

``` sh
$ ./node_modules/.bin/rollup -c

output/Main/index.js â†’ myapp-bundle.js...
created myapp-bundle.js in 874ms
```


## Note on ES6 modules

ECMAScript 6, the latest version of the JavaScript language, enables an ES6 JavaScript module to define its dependencies in a synchronous manner while keeping its ability to be executed in an ES6-compliant web browser. PureScript currently doesn't output ES6-formatted modules because not all browsers completely support ES6 and the PureScript project wants to output JavaScript compatible with as many JavaScript runtimes as possible. ES6 modules are enticing because they remove the need to perform a bundling step.
